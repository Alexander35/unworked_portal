\section{Afterword}

Hope you find \footahref{https://synrc.com/apps/n2o}{N2O},
\footahref{https://synrc.com/apps/kvs}{KVS}, and
\footahref{https://synrc.com/apps/mad}{MAD} stack small and concise,
because it was the main goal during development.
We stay with minimal viable functionality criteria.

\paragraph{}
N2O is free from unnecessary layers and code calls as much as possible.
At the same time it covers all your needs to build
flexible web messaging relays using rich stack of protocols.

\paragraph{}
Minimalistic criteria allows you to see the system's
most general representation, which drives you to describe efficiently.
You could be more productive by focusing on core.
Erlang N2O and companion libraries altogether make
your life managing web applications easy without
efforts due to its naturally compact and simple design, and absence of code bloat.

\paragraph{}
You can see that parse\_transform is very useful, especially in JavaScript
protocol generation (SHEN) and REST record-to-proplist generators. So having
quote/unquote in language would be very useful. Fast and small
Erlang Lisp (LOL) is expecting compiler is this field as universal
Lisp-based macro system.

\paragraph{}
All apps in stack operate on its own DSL records-based language:
N2O --- \#action/\#element; KVS --- \#iterator/\#container.
This language is accessible directly from Erlang-based languages: Joxa, Elixir, Erlang, Lol.

\paragraph{}
We hope that this book will guide you in the wild world of Erlang web development
and you will be enlightened by its minimalistic power.
